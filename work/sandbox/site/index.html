    <div class="section" id="section_introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Ruby Facets is the single largest collection of general purpose method
extensions and system additions for the Ruby programming language.
</p>
<p>
The CORE extensions is a large collection of methods which extend the core
capabilities of Ruby&#8217;s built-in classes and modules. This collection
of extension methods are unique by virtue of their atomicity. The methods
are generally stored in individual files so that each can be required
independently. This gives developers the potential for much finer control
over which extra methods to bring into their code.
</p>
<p>
The MORE additions are a collection of classes, modules and lightweight
systems which constitute an ever improving source of reusable components.
This set of libraries is kept light and focused on useful to a wide variety
of usecases.
</p>
</div><div class="section" id="section_release_notes"><h2>Release Notes</h2>
<p>
Please see Facets Blog (<a href="http://facets.rubyforge.org">http://facets.rubyforge.org</a>).
</p>
</div><div class="section" id="section_documentation"><h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
Facets has special documentation needs due to it&#8217;s extensive bredth.
The RDocs generated when installing via RubyGems, are unweildly because it
combines all of Facets in one set of docs. Hopefully we can remedy this in
the future. In the mean time the gem package includes better documentation
&#8212;divided into two sections in the doc/rdoc directory.
</p>
<p>
Online documentaiton is available at
<a href="http://facets.rubyforge.org/learn.html">http://facets.rubyforge.org/learn.html</a>. There is a &quot;Quick Doc&quot;
feature that can be a bit more convenient then the usual RDocs. Prior to
2.3.1 off-line docs had to be downloaded via a separate package, but this
is no longer the case. I&#8217;ve seen past the stigma of not including
documentation along with the package itself (the extra 500K isn&#8217;t
even a floppy disk folks!), so you will find them in the doc/ directory of
whatever package you have choosen to install. In fact, a good package
installer should give you the option to install those in the appropriate
place in your system anyway (eg. in /usr/share/doc/facets/).
</p>
</div><div class="section" id="section_installation"><h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to install is via RubyGems.
</p>
<pre>
  $ gem install facets
</pre>
<p>
To install manually, your will need Ruby Setup
(http::/setup.rubyforge.org). Then download and unpack the .tar.gz package
and run:
</p>
<pre>
  $ tar -xvzf facets-2.x.x.tar.gz
  $ cd facets-2.x.x
  $ sudo setup.rb
</pre>
</div><div class="section" id="section_compatibility_with_1.x"><h2>Compatibility with 1.x</h2>
<p>
Prior to 2.0, Facets was divided between CORE and MORE &#8212;standalone
extensions vs. classes and modules, respectively. With 2.0, the notion of
&quot;CORE&quot; has taken on a slightly different meaning. Instead CORE
now consists of the libraries that are thought &quot;essential&quot; and as
such are loaded automatically when using ++require &quot;facets&quot;++.
While still primarily made up of extension methods, some modules and
classes may now belong to core as well.
</p>
</div><div class="section" id="section_mission"><h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
Facets holds to the notion that the more we can reasonably integrate into a
common foundation, directed toward general needs, the better that
foundation will be able to serve the community. There are a number of
advantages here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Better Code-reuse

</li>
<li>Collaborative Improvements

</li>
<li>Greater Name Consistency

</li>
<li>One-stop Shop and Installation

</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section" id="section_usage"><h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
For information in usage, please see the special README for the specific
set of libraries:
</p>
<pre>
  README.core     Core Extensions
  README.more     Standard Extensions &amp; Additions
</pre>
<p>
General usage of the CORE library is provided via:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets'
</pre>
<p>
This is the recommended usage. However, you can also &quot;cherry
pick&quot; core methods. While there are exceptions the rule of thumb for
loading a core method is:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/{class|module}/{method}'
</pre>
<p>
See README.core for more information.
</p>
<p>
Using the Facets/MORE library of modules, classes or microframeworks is
essentially the same. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'facets/basicobject'
</pre>
<p>
Again, for details pertaining to the functionality of each feature, please
see the API Docs.
</p>
</div><div class="section" id="section_contribute"><h2>Contribute</h2>
<p>
This project thrives on contribution.
</p>
<p>
If you have any extension methods, classes, modules or small frameworks
that you think have general applicability and would like to see them
included in this project, don&#8217;t hesitiate to submit. Also, if you
have better versions of any thing already included or simply have a patch,
they are more than welcome. We want Ruby Facets to be of the highest
quality.
