== Introduction

Ruby Facets is the single largest collection of general purpose method
extensions and system additions for the Ruby programming language.

The CORE extensions is a large collection of methods which extend the
core capabilities of Ruby's built-in classes and modules. This collection
of extension methods are unique by virtue of their atomicity. The methods
are generally stored in individual files so that each can be required
independently. This gives developers the potential for much finer control
over which extra methods to bring into their code.

The MORE additions are a collection of classes, modules and lightweight systems
which constitute an ever improving source of reusable components. This set of
libraries is kept light and focused on useful to a wide variety of usecases.


== Release Notes

Please see Facets Blog (http://facets.rubyforge.org).


== Documentation

Facets has special documentation needs due to it's extensive bredth.
The RDocs generated when installing via RubyGems, are unweildly because it
combines all of Facets in one set of docs. Hopefully we can remedy this in
the future. In the mean time the gem package includes better documentation
--divided into two sections in the doc/rdoc directory.

Online documentaiton is available at http://facets.rubyforge.org/learn.html.
There is a "Quick Doc" feature that can be a bit more convenient then the usual
RDocs. Prior to 2.3.1 off-line docs had to be downloaded via a separate package,
but this is no longer the case. I've seen past the stigma of not including
documentation along with the package itself (the extra 500K isn't even a floppy
disk folks!), so you will find them in the doc/ directory of whatever package
you have choosen to install. In fact, a good package installer should give you
the option to install those in the appropriate place in your system anyway
(eg. in /usr/share/doc/facets/).


== Installation

The easiest way to install is via RubyGems.

  $ gem install facets

To install manually, your will need Ruby Setup (http::/setup.rubyforge.org).
Then download and unpack the .tar.gz package and run:

  $ tar -xvzf facets-2.x.x.tar.gz
  $ cd facets-2.x.x
  $ sudo setup.rb


== Compatibility with 1.x

Prior to 2.0, Facets was divided between CORE and MORE --standalone extensions
vs. classes and modules, respectively. With 2.0, the notion of "CORE" has taken
on a slightly different meaning. Instead CORE now consists of the libraries that
are thought "essential" and as such are loaded automatically when using
++require "facets"++. While still primarily made up of extension methods, some
modules and classes may now belong to core as well.


== Mission

Facets holds to the notion that the more we can reasonably integrate into
a common foundation, directed toward general needs, the better that foundation
will be able to serve the community. There are a number of advantages here:

* Better Code-reuse
* Collaborative Improvements
* Greater Name Consistency
* One-stop Shop and Installation


== Usage

For information in usage, please see the special README for the specific
set of libraries:

  README.core     Core Extensions
  README.more     Standard Extensions & Additions

General usage of the CORE library is provided via:

  require 'facets'

This is the recommended usage. However, you can also "cherry pick" core
methods. While there are exceptions the rule of thumb for loading a core
method is:

  require 'facets/{class|module}/{method}'

See README.core for more information.

Using the Facets/MORE library of modules, classes or microframeworks is
essentially the same. For example:

  require 'facets/basicobject'

Again, for details pertaining to the functionality of each feature, please see
the API Docs.


== Contribute

This project thrives on contribution.

If you have any extension methods, classes, modules or small frameworks that
you think have general applicability and would like to see them included in
this project, don't hesitiate to submit. Also, if you have better versions
of any thing already included or simply have a patch, they are more than
welcome. We want Ruby Facets to be of the highest quality.
